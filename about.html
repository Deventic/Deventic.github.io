                                I often joke that I’m a "chronically stupid being with too much time"—a label I embrace with a sense of humor. My curiosity drives me to dive into new technologies, often starting with little knowledge but a lot of persistence. Whether it’s learning C# through Brackeys' tutorials or tackling data science with Python, I’ve learned that failure is just another step toward success. Inspired by creators like Code Bullet, Mark Rober, and DougDoug, I approach every project with creativity and a willingness to push boundaries, even when I’m out of my depth. After all, having "too much time" is just an opportunity to experiment, learn, and grow.

                            <p>
                                From a young age, I was fascinated by video games and always curious about how they were made. This curiosity led me to explore programming, starting with C# through Brackeys' tutorials. What began as a desire to create games soon expanded into a passion for game development, data science, and data visualization. Over time, I’ve honed my skills by taking on diverse projects, learning through experimentation, and tackling new challenges. Today, I’m driven by the excitement of bringing ideas to life through code and continuing to grow as a developer.

                                        For me, technology isn’t just about solving problems—it’s about creating something new, something that can change the way we interact with the world. I thrive on the creative side of development, whether designing gameplay mechanics in Unity or visualizing data to reveal insights. I believe that innovative solutions often come from thinking outside the box, experimenting with new ideas, and combining different technologies in unexpected ways. My work is guided by the principle that creativity is just as important as technical expertise, and that the most exciting solutions come from daring to be different.

                                        The journey to mastering new skills or creating something meaningful isn’t always easy, and I embrace the challenge. I believe that persistence and resilience are key to overcoming obstacles and achieving success. Whether it’s debugging a piece of code that’s just not working or trying to understand a complex dataset, I know that failure is just a part of the learning process. It’s through persistence—pushing forward despite setbacks—that true growth happens. I approach every challenge with the mindset that every mistake is an opportunity to learn and improve, making me stronger and more capable each time.

                                        I’m deeply passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. Whether it's optimizing a game’s performance, analyzing large datasets to uncover insights, or creating interactive user experiences, I see each project as an opportunity to develop a solution that makes an impact. I approach every problem analytically, breaking it down into manageable pieces, and focusing on the most efficient and creative way to solve it. My belief in problem-solving drives me to constantly improve my skills and techniques, always searching for ways to make my work better, smarter, and more impactful.

                                        Tech doesn’t have to be all seriousness and structure—it should also be fun! I believe that when you enjoy the process of building and experimenting, the results are more creative and effective. Whether I’m designing a game mechanic or analyzing data, I make sure to approach each project with a sense of playfulness and curiosity. This playful mindset keeps me motivated and engaged, allowing me to think more creatively and find joy in the challenges I face. I believe the best work is often born out of passion and fun, and I try to bring that energy to everything I do.
